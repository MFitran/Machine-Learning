## UTS Regression Analysis

### Description

The UTS Regression project focuses on regression analysis using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook `UTS_Regresi.ipynb` contains various methods and models to analyze and predict outcomes based on input data.

### Methodology

1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
4. **Model Selection:** Implement various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees).
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Results

The notebook includes visualizations of the regression results and performance metrics for each model.

## UTS Classification Analysis

### Description

The UTS Classification project focuses on classification analysis using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook `UTS_Klasifikasi.ipynb` contains various methods and models to classify data into different categories.

### Methodology

1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
4. **Model Selection:** Implement various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

### Results

The notebook includes visualizations of the classification results and performance metrics for each model.

## UTS Clustering Analysis

### Description

The UTS Clustering project focuses on clustering analysis using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook `UTS_Clustering.ipynb` contains various methods and models to group data into clusters based on similarities.

### Methodology

1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for clustering.
4. **Model Selection:** Implement various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
5. **Cluster Evaluation:** Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as Silhouette Score and visualizations.

### Results

The notebook includes visualizations of the clusters formed and performance metrics for each clustering method.
