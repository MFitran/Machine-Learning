**Introduction:**

The UTS Clustering project aims to explore clustering models to identify natural groupings in the dataset. This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to implementing clustering analysis using Python.

---

**Requirements:**

To run this notebook, you will need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

**Data Description:**

- The dataset used in this analysis includes various features relevant to the clustering task.
- Data is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize features as necessary.

---

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for clustering.
4. **Model Selection:** Implement various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
5. **Cluster Evaluation:** Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as Silhouette Score and visualizations.

---

**Results:**

- The notebook includes visualizations of the clusters formed.
- Performance metrics for each clustering method are provided to compare effectiveness.

---

**Conclusion:**

The UTS Clustering analysis demonstrates the application of clustering techniques in machine learning. The results indicate the effectiveness of different models in identifying patterns and groupings within the dataset.
