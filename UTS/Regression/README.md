**Data Description:**

- The dataset used in this analysis includes various features relevant to the regression task.
- Data is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize features as necessary.

---

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
4. **Model Selection:** Implement various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees).
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

---

**Results:**

- The notebook includes visualizations of the regression results.
- Performance metrics for each model are provided to compare effectiveness.
